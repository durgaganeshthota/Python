**🐍SNAKE GAME WITH SPEED CONTROLS🎮**


This Snake Game project holds a special place in my heart as it was the very first video game I played during my childhood. Inspired by the nostalgia, I decided to create my own version of the Snake Game using Python and the Turtle module. The game not only captures the essence of the classic Snake Game but also introduces an exciting twist. I wanted to enhance the gameplay experience by allowing players to change the speed of the snake in the middle of the game. The score in the game is now directly tied to the speed at which the snake moves.

Here are the key features of this Snake Game project:

**🕹️Speed Control:** 

_Unlike traditional Snake Games, this version enables players to adjust the speed of the snake at any point during gameplay. This feature adds an extra layer of challenge and flexibility, allowing players to adapt to different difficulty levels._

**🚀High Score Saving:**

_The game incorporates a high score system that saves the highest achieved score on the player's computer. This feature motivates players to improve their gameplay and beat their own records._

**🎮Python Code and Executable:**

_The Snake Game is implemented using Python, making it accessible to developers who want to explore and modify the code. Additionally, I have provided an executable (.exe) file for users who don't have Python installed on their computers, enabling them to play the game directly._

**🕹️Familiar Gameplay:**

_The Snake Game maintains the familiar gameplay mechanics found in small keypad mobiles. The player controls a snake, guiding it to eat eggs and grow longer. However, with the added speed control and score based on speed, the game brings a fresh and exciting twist to the classic concept._

The game interface displays essential information such as the speed of the snake, the number of eggs eaten, the current score, and the highest score achieved. Additionally, I have included screenshots within the game to provide players with a visual representation of their progress and accomplishments 🐍.

Feel free to download the Python code or use the provided executable file to experience this nostalgic Snake Game with a modern twist. Whether you want to challenge your high score, test your agility with different speeds, or simply relive the memories of the original Snake Game, this project offers a fun and engaging experience for players of all ages. Enjoy the game and have a great time playing🎮!
