🐢 **TURTLE MAZE GAME: DINF THE WAY**🎮

I am excited to share a simple yet engaging game that I created using Python's Turtle module. It's a maze-solving challenge where you guide a determined turtle through a complex maze to find the exit. The game offers an interactive experience, complete with controls and helpful symbols.

🕹️ **Gameplay**:

_Using either the arrow keys or the W, A, S, D keys, you can navigate the turtle through the maze. Your goal is to reach the exit, marked by a special symbol. The game presents an intuitive interface, allowing you to immerse yourself in solving the maze and testing your navigation skills._

🔄 **Restart Option**:

_Sometimes, finding your way through the maze can be challenging. To offer a seamless experience, the game provides a restart option. If you find yourself stuck or wish to improve your performance, simply press the "R" key to restart the game. It ensures that you can keep exploring and conquering the maze without interruptions._

💡 **How to Play:**

_1️⃣ Launch the game and study the maze layout._
_2️⃣ Use the arrow keys or the W, A, S, D keys to navigate the turtle through the maze._
_3️⃣ Find the exit symbol to reach the goal and complete the maze._
_4️⃣ If you get stuck or want to start fresh, press the "R" key to restart the game._
_5️⃣ Enjoy the interactive elements by clicking on the symbols to play again and again!
