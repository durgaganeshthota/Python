**Project 01: _Snake_**
    
    Snake Game with speed control and high score saving. Play the classic game with a twist - change the snake's speed during gameplay. The score is based on speed, and the highest score is saved. Python code and executable are available, with screenshots to track progress. Enjoy the nostalgia!
